# MSE TSM MobCom Project PlantWateringApp

## Project description
The application includes a plant irrigation device that measures the soil humidity and opens a valve, that automatically waters the plant. So that programmers don't have to leave the PC fur such mundane tasks.

Use case: a user should be able to set a soil moisture threshold for his plant. The user can do this via app. When a threshold has been set, the user will receive data about the current soil moisture of his plant and the device will automatically trigger the watering system when the threshold for the soil moisture is undershot. The user only has to refill the water tank from time to time. Furthermore, the data is sent to a cloud backend, so that they can be shared between different members of the same household.
